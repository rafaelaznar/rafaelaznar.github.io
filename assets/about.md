# about me

* Hi there! I work as a professor in the CIPFP Ausiàs March de València (Spain).
* In the 90s I graduated from [UPV](https://www.upv.es/en) in computer science. I also studied a master degree there.
* I’m over fifties and i've been working as a teacher for more than twenty years. I'm currently teaching web development.
* I'm a full stack developer. I started learning about programming computers when I was 15 years old, and I haven’t stopped coding ever since. I currently program in java and javascript / typescript, but I've been working for years in many languages such as basic, dbase, pascal, modula 2, delphi, visual basic, c, c++, lisp, prolog, php, java, javascript, typescript ... even assembler. I also know about frameworks and tecnologies directly related to the Internet and the Web.
* I'm both native valencian and spanish speaker and I communicate well in english.
* You can email me: rafaaznar at gmail dot com.
