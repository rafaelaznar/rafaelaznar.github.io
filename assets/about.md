# about me

* Hi there! I work as a professor in the CIPFP Ausiàs March de València (Spain).

* I'm a full stack developer. I started learning about programming computers when I was 15 years old, and I haven’t stopped coding ever since.
* I currently program in java and javascript / typescript, but i've been working for years in many languages such as php, visual basic, pascal, c, c++, lisp, prolog ... even assembler.
