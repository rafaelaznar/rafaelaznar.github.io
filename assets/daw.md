# DAW projects

On this page I'm going to show the development of my teaching projects in DAW. All projects on this page are published under the MIT license. In each project I will notice its degree of completion and stability. Many students of web application development at CIPFP Ausias March in Valencia have collaborated on some of the projects shown below. This page is a work in progress and will be changing frequently.

I follow a learning-by-doing approach. And these are the projects I use to illustrate my students.
