# Roadmap to BLASTER

BLASTER methodology aims to learn by building projects. 
But you can't learn if you don't have enough foundations to understand the projects. 
In this roadmap I propose an itinerary so that with my help you will be able to write complex AJAX web projects in just a few months.
But I encourage you to learn by building in a group and be supervised by a qualified instructor.
