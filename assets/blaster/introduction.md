**BLASTER** is an educational project to learn web development.

I chose this title because a BLASTER is a fictional weapon that appears for example in Star Wars and Blade Runner and that has connotations related to science fiction that I consider to be are attractive in the context of this project. But also BLASTER contains the initials of the phrase: 

>"let's Build, Learn And Share all TogetherER". 

And I have chosen this title because it summarizes the keys to this project, which I explain:

Firstly, I wanted to write the title in English because I want to highlight the importance of the English language for developers. Knowledge of the English language is very important to develop software since the standards and documentations of the products are in English. Many of the problems that developers find in our work have already been solved previously, and developers have shared the solution most of the time in English (on reference websites such as Stack Overflow).

The title is written in the plural for two reasons: it invites all students to participate in the project and reminds workgroup and inclusion with the words **"ALL TOGETHER"**. I wanted to reinforce the importance of students working in groups and encourage them to share knowledge, since the work of a software developer is a team effort. 

The word **"BUILD"** refers to the skills we are learning, which is software developer, where in most cases students will have to create or keep software at work. I also like to point out that the process of software construction is always a creative process, and I like students to be active to experiment, to imagine new solutions, and to take their own decisions when creating web applications.

I have included the word **"LEARN"** because we have built a computer system in the web to learn and not for commercial purposes. This fact frees us from the pressure of getting commercial finishes in a short time, because the important thing about the project has been that the students have learned to build web applications.

Finally, the word **"SHARE"** refers to the importance that I want students to give to share code and knowledge with colleagues, so that the group has more consistent learning. In addition, the purpose of the project is to raise awareness for students about the importance of sharing software with open licenses in order to help other people in their learning process. The purpose of this project was to generate a product software on the web and share it with an MIT "open source" license with a double objective:

* For all members of the group to be benefit from the open source of a complex web application that they had developed by themselves. And also they had a model on which to rely to generate their own applications.
* And so that future classmates could use the system to learn through its study, modification and expansion. Students are encouraging to learn by building together but with the intention of sharing through MIT license so that other people can benefit from our efforts.
