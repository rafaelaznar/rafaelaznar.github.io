# Object oriented programming

## Introduction to OOP
### What is OOP and why is it important?
OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming, which is a programming paradigm that focuses on organizing code into objects that contain data and methods. In OOP, objects are instances of classes, which define the properties and behaviors of the objects.

OOP is important because it allows developers to write code that is more modular, reusable, and easier to maintain. By encapsulating data and behavior into objects, OOP makes it possible to create complex systems that are easier to understand and modify. OOP also makes it possible to write code that is more secure, as objects can be designed to only expose certain methods and properties to the outside world, while keeping other data and behavior private. Additionally, OOP can improve code performance, as objects can be designed to be more efficient than procedural code in certain scenarios.
### Key concepts in OOP: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that revolves around the use of objects that contain data and methods to manipulate that data. The following are the key concepts in OOP:

1. Encapsulation: This is the practice of grouping data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit called a class. The class controls the access to the data, which can only be accessed through the methods defined in the class. Encapsulation helps to keep the code organized, maintainable, and secure by hiding the implementation details from the outside world.

2. Inheritance: This is the concept where a class can inherit properties and methods from another class. The class that inherits the properties and methods is called the child class, while the class from which it inherits is called the parent class or super class. Inheritance promotes code reuse, reduces code duplication, and makes the code more manageable.

3. Polymorphism: This is the ability of objects of different classes to be used interchangeably. In other words, different objects can respond to the same method call in different ways. Polymorphism allows for more flexibility and extensibility in the code.

Overall, these concepts help to make the code more modular, easier to maintain, and more scalable.
### Understanding objects in OOP in Javascript
In OOP, objects are instances of classes that encapsulate data and behavior. In JavaScript, objects are a fundamental data type, and they can be created using object literals, constructor functions, or ES6 classes.

Object literals are a simple way to create objects in JavaScript. An object literal is a comma-separated list of name-value pairs enclosed in curly braces. Here's an example:

```javascript
const person = {
  firstName: 'John',
  lastName: 'Doe',
  age: 30,
  getFullName() {
    return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
  },
};
```

Constructor functions are a way to create objects with shared behavior. Constructor functions are defined using the `function` keyword and are intended to be called with the `new` keyword. Inside the constructor function, you can initialize the object's properties and methods using the `this` keyword. Here's an example:

```javascript
function Person(firstName, lastName, age) {
  this.firstName = firstName;
  this.lastName = lastName;
  this.age = age;
}

Person.prototype.getFullName = function() {
  return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
};

const person = new Person('John', 'Doe', 30);
```

ES6 classes are syntactic sugar for constructor functions and prototypes. They provide a more familiar syntax for creating classes, and they also offer some additional features, such as static methods and getters/setters. Here's an example:

```javascript
class Person {
  constructor(firstName, lastName, age) {
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;
    this.age = age;
  }

  getFullName() {
    return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
  }
}

const person = new Person('John', 'Doe', 30);
```

Overall, understanding objects in JavaScript is important for building complex applications that leverage the principles of OOP.

### Protoypes

In JavaScript, every object has a prototype. A prototype is an object from which the object inherits its properties and methods. 

When a property or method is accessed on an object, JavaScript looks for the property or method on the object first. If the property or method is not found on the object, JavaScript looks for it on the object's prototype. If the property or method is still not found, JavaScript looks for it on the prototype's prototype, and so on, until it reaches the end of the prototype chain.

In JavaScript, prototypes are implemented using the `prototype` property of constructor functions. When an object is created using a constructor function, its prototype is set to the `prototype` property of the constructor function.

For example, consider the following constructor function:

```javascript
function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
}

Person.prototype.sayHello = function() {
  console.log("Hello, my name is " + this.name);
};
```

In this example, the `Person` constructor function defines a `sayHello` method on its prototype. When an object is created using the `Person` constructor function, it will inherit the `sayHello` method from the `Person.prototype` object:

```javascript
var person = new Person("John", 30);
person.sayHello(); // logs "Hello, my name is John"
```

The `person` object does not have a `sayHello` method defined on it directly, but it inherits the method from its prototype, which is the `Person.prototype` object.

### Object Properties and Methods

In JavaScript, objects are collections of properties, which can be either data properties or accessor properties, and methods. Properties are values that are associated with an object, while methods are functions that are associated with an object and can perform some action or return a value.

Object properties can be defined using either dot notation or bracket notation. For example:

```javascript
const myObject = {};
myObject.property1 = 'value1'; // dot notation
myObject['property2'] = 'value2'; // bracket notation
```

Object methods are functions that are defined as properties of an object. For example:

```javascript
const myObject = {
  myMethod: function() {
    console.log('Hello, world!');
  }
};

myObject.myMethod(); // prints "Hello, world!"
```

Methods can also be defined using shorthand notation:

```javascript
const myObject = {
  myMethod() {
    console.log('Hello, world!');
  }
};

myObject.myMethod(); // prints "Hello, world!"
```

In addition to properties and methods that are defined directly on an object, objects can also inherit properties and methods from their prototype object using the prototype chain. The prototype object is essentially a template object that is used to create new objects that share its properties and methods. When a property or method is accessed on an object, if the object does not have a property or method with that name, JavaScript will look up the prototype chain to find the property or method on the object's prototype or its prototype's prototype, and so on.

Understanding object properties and methods is important in object-oriented programming because it allows developers to create complex and flexible data structures that can be used to model real-world entities and behaviors.
