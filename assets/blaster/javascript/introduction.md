# Introduction

JavaScript is a high-level programming language that is commonly used to create interactive web pages and web applications. It was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich while he was working at Netscape Communications Corporation.

JavaScript is a dynamic, weakly typed language, which means that data types are inferred at runtime and can change during execution. It is also a client-side language, which means that it runs on the user's computer and not on the server.

JavaScript can be used for a wide range of tasks, including creating animations, validating form data, and manipulating the content of web pages. It is also commonly used to build front-end web applications using popular frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular.

In addition to its use in the browser, JavaScript can also be used on the server-side through platforms like Node.js. This allows developers to build full-stack web applications using the same language on both the client and server sides.

JavaScript is a highly popular language, and its community is constantly developing new tools, libraries, and frameworks to improve its functionality and ease of use. This makes it an exciting language to learn and work with, especially for those interested in web development.
