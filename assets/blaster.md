BLASTER stands for let's Build, Learn And Share all TogethER (“Vamos a construir, aprender y compartir todos juntos”)


[Introduction to BLASTER](blaster/introduction.md)

## WildCart
### Development in progress

Now I'm working on this:
* internationalization (in progress)
* adding user comments for product (in progress)
* changin authentication to JWT

Next mailstone for WildCart:
* I'm going to end all working in progress and fork the project to obtain a new version that I will call TrollEyes. I'm going to simplify the forked WildCart (Trolleyes) for the students to learn. TrollEyes is going to be the easy link in the learning chain betwwen blogBuster and WildCart.
* Trolleyes will remain autentication with Java server sessions while WildCart will implement JWT authentication (taken from Andamio Server)
* Trolleyes front-end components will be simplified to be easy to understand.
